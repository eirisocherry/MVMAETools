- Installation:
   Navigate to your After Effects directory (eg C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects xxx)
   Extact the zip file so that it overwrites the Support Files directory.

 - Usage:
   After importing your footage, whilst it is in your composition and selected, press the
   'Import Camera' button to link the camera paths
   
 - Notes:
   Importing sun works, but is not completely accurate. Converting a world-space NULL object to
   a screen-space 2D NULL may result in the opposite projection.
